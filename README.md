# Python Lab

Python exercises taken from [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/), used by me for teaching a workshop of Python. It was originally intended only for the students at the [ROSEdu Community and Development Lab](http://cdl.rosedu.org/) in 2014, but I've used it at more events since then.

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10lZyWTD_LPKHhQbQFfUnoe2Ng45K89wTlyFxXJkQuMU/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000) that help me not forget what to show to the students.

# Plan

The course takes two hours. The plan is:

* first present Python specific stuff from the first slide
* make a demo in the terminal and tell them about variables
* code the first function (they should code along)
* explain in the terminal strings (everything should have taken ~30 mins)
* leave them 20 mins for `string1.py` and another 10 mins for `string2.py`
* explain lists (~10 mins)
* `list1.py` takes around 10 mins and `list2.py` another 10 mins
* show dicts and reading files (~10 mins)
* maybe show them OOP at the end and give them the [Codecademy OOP](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-intermediate-en-WL8e4/3/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096) exercises
